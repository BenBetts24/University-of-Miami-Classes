# ECE118
Contains source and library files for all of the ECE118 lab assignments. ECE118 is University of Miami's intro to coding class taught in C++.

To run any of this code, create an empty project in Visual Studio and add the library files included in the repo.
Rename the file that you want to run "source" and add it to the project.
After that, the code should run as intended!

Unfortunately, the library files only work in Visual Studio 2010. For library files that match your version, check http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/library/index.html

Also, labs with a * next to their name were created in a UNIX text editor and compiled separately, so they don't need the library files!

# Quick Lab Summaries:

Lab 07: Focus on working with visual libraries and random generation. Randomly generates a city scene.

Lab 08: Focus on UI creation with visual libraries. Fully interactive calculator with UI.

Lab 09: Reads files and uses several new data structures to graph weather data with a well designed UI.
