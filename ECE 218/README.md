# ECE218
Contains source and library files for all of the ECE218 lab assignments. ECE218 is University of Miami's Data Structures coding class taught in C++.

All of the data structures used in this course (except for the C++ string) were written by myself as was required by the course.

To run any of this code, simply add it to UNIX on a mac or dedicated server. Compile with g++ (make sure to include all .cpp files in your compiling command), then run the new executable.

# Quick Lab Summaries:

Lab 2: Learning 4 basic algorithms and testing their timing. Used bash scripting to automate timing of over 150 sorts.

Lab 3: Learning about linked lists and sorting inserts vs adding then inserting.

Lab 4: Learning stacks and queues by creating our own and using them for various tasks

Lab 6: Learning Merge/Quick Sort and Binary Search Trees. This two part lab tested more sorting and storage methods.

Exam 2: A take home exam that used stacks to simulate multiple games of blackjack based on set rules and random selection.
