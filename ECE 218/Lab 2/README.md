# Lab 2

This lab was all about four basic sorting algorithms:
- Bubble
- Shaker (aka Cocktail)
- Selection
- Insertion

Each sort was timed 3 times for various sizes of arrays. Each timing was averaged and graphed in the lab report.

To save time and stop myself from needing to run this program myself each time, I created a bash script that would give the program the proper input and save its output for every test.

Lab 2 Lab Report contains detailed compiling and running instructions.
